                Frame<br>
                If frame protects and accepts light, it will be a filter. Also, the features of frame and filter could be mutually determined by intention.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 200px">    
                Filter<br>
                Filter can be intentional. It is manipulated with frame, and multiple kinds of filters layered could make brightness and shades in building.
            </p>    
            <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 200px">    
                Unfiltered<br>
                The amounts of filters cannot be ignored by light. Human body would be accustomed to filtered view. If building is inverted, they can see the frames from unfiltered view.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 200px">    
                Body<br>
                Human body moves with filters, and the movement is saved as data in camera. It is informative for explaining city's form.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 200px">    
                Recording<br>                
                Recording mediates the experience of walking. Camera as an observation device registers information with many of filters. It records their observations such as the homless, trashes, abandoned furnitures and empty spaces on the street.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 200px">    
                Camera<br>
                Recording with camera inevitably recognizes frame and filter. Camera memorizes the difference between information and reality, saved in time. As they change the movement, it is variable.
            </p>    
            <p style="font-family: Tahoma, sans serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 200px">    
                Unintentional<br>                
                If they turn on the camera with filters, they eventually adopt intentional way. To record in unintentional way, they devise some tools. Recording with camera turned on and attached it on their body during walking could be an automatic record. It makes shots automatically before editing.<br>

                Editing-Video<br>
                Editing can be a process of intention. After recording, they are editing to make the video finished. But, as a result of observation, video can include the city's chronotype.
