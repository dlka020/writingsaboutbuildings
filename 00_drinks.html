                OVERLAPPED LAYERS<br>
                Division of programs and separated rooms make people misunderstand experiences in gallery. High relevance among rooms is needed to be closer to each other, which creates layered memory from people walking and looking around inside. For example, exhibition hall and sculpture garden can be assembled.
                Also, education room can be adjunct to corridor with works of art. Distance between rooms for each program and visibility among them can encourage people to make relations individually and be exposed to variable situations.

                SENSE OF DISCOVERY<br>
                When people should go upstairs, they necessarily use  elevator or stairs, which makes people feel uncomfortable. Feeling uncomfortableness may be come from wandering for getting to destinations or finding how to go somewhere in strict and rigid arrangement of space.
                If one is unfamiliar with seeing and enjoying various and multiple works of art, he can be easily frustrated or bored with staying at gallery, which prevents him entering gallery at his next free time.
                Without starting designing from conventional circulation such as elevators, floor and stairs, encouraging people to freely move between space and another space is the main question. Inside, by walking around overlapped layers and gradual sequences that provide instinctive journey, people inevitably and successively meet a variety of situations related to works of art and surroundings and make their own narratives.
