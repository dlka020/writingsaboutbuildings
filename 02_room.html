                Any Regulations in 'Metaverse'?<br>
                Most people are using mobile device for numerous reasons and at a variety of situations, such as smart phone, tablet PC, laptop and desktop. Also, it causes them to meet lots of images in daily life.<br>
                In the past, people consume works of art as religious symbol for demestic purpose and for educating and delivering meanings. Today, additional to the past things, to communicate each other becomes to occupy significant ratio of the whole, which indicates that there are lower barriers for people in making artworks and consuming and using images. This phenomenon should be affected by emgergence of machine and device, and clearly, it is updating today's images that people in the present encounter and consume in physical environment and on the Internet. For example, recently, most of fields and industries including computer science and visual culture struggle to take the initiative on XR technololgy. To explain it, 'Information Age' and 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' is used.<br>
                VR and AR technology are upgraded to 'Metaverse', and many people are curious about whether metaverse is categorized as art or not. Before the main question, in this text, metaverse is mentioned as a part of technology. Metaverse is made of digital graphic, image data set and algorithms, and users in metaverse communicate with other users or avatars in 3D virtual space online. By watching the screen and reacting to algorithms that programmers planned, with keyboards, mouses and touch screens, they can make their own narratives in digital spaces. At this point, the key characteristic of metaverse is interactivity. Contrary to the past, video, audio and user's physical control based on programmer's algorithms, produce works finished quickly.<br>
                In fact, images offline and online are exchanged as currency, and the value and the evaluation of those would be determined by perspectives of collectors and consumers. By the way, regulations offline usually have evidence on the actual effects. From the main question, if the regulations may be applied to metaverse or not. As mentioned ahead, metaverse should be referred to technology. However, I think the quality of metaverse can be on the basis of art because it paradoxically relies on audio-visual images to communicate. In short, what to see in metaverse ironically might be regulated, furthermore supervised.<br>
                As the advance of metaverse, the ability of cognition is complicated, actually. Original images are printed out as various type of papers, and camera is used for capturing daily life as form of photos or video. Digital files replace documents by relying on devices, and people can be confused of perceiving and interpreting visual images between two dimension and three dimension. Also, factors of recognition offline and online are required to change as people are using metaverse including simple dimension on web and sophisticated graphics. Resultingly, what to contain in screen, monitor and frame of camera would be in area of consciousness, and how it is presented and where it is shown are the important question at the same time.
