                I always welcome you with any reasons why you enter 'writingsaboutbuildings'.<br>
                However, I'd like to hear those reasons if you want to let me know about that.<br>
            </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: 200px">Actually, I'm trying to simulate some of ways to show my works taking a form of image or text. I've not known you at all so far, but I expect to have some conversations with you via multiple channels including comments on postings, emails for asks and a few clicks for sharing and publishing.<br>
                This will cover cases of theory and history related to field of art, architecture and design and present my opinions and criticisms using some of artworks. I'm not sure of how specific it is in terms of period, medium and media, but the most important thing would be that my writing is about a kind of building that demonstrates or tells a story about people called as 'users', 'residents' and 'citizens'. So, it definitely contains my own research works. Furthermore, it may be unfinished and a process of study.<br>
                I hope you not to imagine any kinds of result and outcome from it.
