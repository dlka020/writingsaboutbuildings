                Against linear world of sequence, order and standard, we dive into the nonlinear space with discovery, encounter and contacts. As the geological strata would respond to time-passing, we sometimes locate something unruly on space. Objects made for convenience have validity with durability, and a space functions as socio-political evidence by closely interacting with human's life.<br>
                Exhibited works are related to reflection on ego of two artists, and this exhibition is a method to mediate artists and visitors in a space. Two artists put rest of memories out of personal time as individuals, and they think of "life". Finally, they constructed new narratives on the canvas, connecting it directly to the reality and the truth and making paintings with medium of oils, acrylics and canvases.
